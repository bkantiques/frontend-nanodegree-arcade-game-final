To start this game, open the index.html file in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to move. The goal is to get to the water without
getting hit by a bug. Getting to the water increases your score by 100 points.
Each gem is worth 20 points. Your score increases until you are hit by a bug,
at which point you lose and your score resets to 0.
